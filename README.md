# Well Interestion Program
## Program Description
This program reads the coordinates of a reservoir and its respective wells from a file. Then it checks for each well's intersection point with the reservoir, specifying the grid cell that each well intersects. 
## Program Pre-requisites
Before using this program, ensure that you have:

- A C++ development environment installed on your computer.
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
- File containing all the necessary data about the reservoir and wells.
## Data File
- The file must be in a certain format for the program to work.
- The file must contain the reservoir built from grid cells. Each grid cell has an ID number.
- The file must contain a minimum of one grid cell
- Each grid cell must contain exactly 8 points with x, y, and z values.
- If the user attempts to enter more than 8 points for a single grid cell the program will display a Warning.
- The well must consist of a minimum of 3 points.
- The well's coordinates are represented using a vertical or horizontal line.
- Keywords in the file must remain untouched for the proper execution of the code.
